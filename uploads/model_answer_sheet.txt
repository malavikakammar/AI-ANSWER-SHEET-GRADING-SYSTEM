A1. Comets are one of the members of our solar system. They have
tremendously elliptic orbits around the Sun. Their time of revolution
around the Sun, on the other hand, is usually quite long. A comet is
characterized by a luminous head and a long tail. As it gets closer to the
sun, the length of the tail lengthens. A comet's tail is always pointed
away from the sun.

A2. Electrostatic force is the force caused due to attraction or repulsion
of electric charges between two particles. This is a non-contact force ,
therefore it acts when two charged bodies are brought closer to each
other.

A3. The full moon day is the day when the entire disc of the moon is
visible. Every night following that, the size of the bright section of the
moon appears to get smaller and smaller. The moon is not visible on
the fifteenth day. The new moon day is celebrated on this day. The day
after the new moon, only a small part of the moon is visible in the sky.
This is known as the crescent moon. The moon slowly gets bigger every
day. We obtain another full view of the moon on the fifteenth day. The
various shapes of the bright part of the moon as seen during a month
are called phases of the moon.

A4. The shape of the eye is generally spherical. The eye's outer layer is
white. It is tough in order to protect the interior of the eye from
damage. The cornea is the translucent front section of the eye. The iris
is a dark muscular tissue that lies behind the cornea. The pupil is a tiny
aperture in the iris that allows light to pass through. The iris regulates
the size of the pupil. The iris is the colored portion of the eye.
